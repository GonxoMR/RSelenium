R Bindings for Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver
==========================

*** NOTE: Most of the JSON Wire Protocol http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
***     has been implemented. This is still beta quality code.

This is a R Binding for Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver, which you
should download from http://code.google.com/p/selenium; look for
selenium-server-standalone.jar.  This binding will not work with the
1.0 version of Selenium.

This library borrowed heavily from the perl implemetation detailed here 
https://metacpan.org/release/Selenium-Remote-Driver.

To install, install the `devtools` package if necessary (`install.packages("devtools")`) and run:

```
devtools::install_github("RSelenium", "johndharrison")
```
