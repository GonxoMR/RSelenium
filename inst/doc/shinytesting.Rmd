# RSelenium: Testing Shiny Apps

## Introduction

The goal of this vignette is to give a basic overview of how one might approach "testing" a shiny app. [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) is a new package from [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) that makes it dramatically easier to build interactive web applications with R. Shiny Uses a reactive programming model and has built-in widgets derived from the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) front-end framework.
